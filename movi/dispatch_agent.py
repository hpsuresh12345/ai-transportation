T - time horison, e.g. predict demand from now T hours onwoard

Reward:
    >> To  define reward, we wish  to  minimize  three  performance  criteria:  the  number  
    >> of service rejects, passenger waiting time and idle cruising time. A reject means a 
    >> ride request that could not be served within a given amount of time because of no 
    >> available vehicles neara customer. Thewaiting timeis defined by the time between a 
    >> passengerâ€™s placing a pickup request and the matched driverpicking up the  
    >> passenger; even  if a request is not rejected,passengers would prefer to  
    >> be  picked up sooner rather thanlater. Finally, theidle cruising timeis the 
    >> time in which a taxiis unoccupied and therefore not generating revenue, while 
    >> still incurring costs like gasoline and wear on the vehicle.

        i and j - regions (cells)
        lambda - cost of reject
        M - number of regions (cells)
